## [Delayed Validation (Debounced)](#debounce-example)

You can specify a delay to debounce the input event, a case scenario that you may want to wait for the user to stop typing then validate the field. This can be achieved by adding a `data-vv-delay` attribute on the field being validated, and assign it the number of milliseconds you want to wait for.
